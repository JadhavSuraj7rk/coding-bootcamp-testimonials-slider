## My process

I approached this simple card using a mobile first workflow, only to realize the card itself doesn't change at all for the desktop version so there wasn't much to do regarding responsive design. 

I built out the layout for the card and background using flexbox and found it to be mostly what I was expecting. The colors given in the style guide were particularly representative of the design. Yes they were used, but there is a color used for the border between the card sections that isn't listed, and I couldn't find where they had used the "Very dark desaturated blue" color at all.

### Feedback

 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
